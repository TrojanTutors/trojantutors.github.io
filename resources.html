          <h4><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html#hph">HyperPhysics</a></h4>
          <p>My favorite site for learning physics concepts. Unlike your textbooks, HyperPhysics has no BS. It gets right to the key information using easy-to-read diagrams, pictures, and examples. The site is arranged like a "network" of related ideas, showing how different concepts are connected and allowing you to easily find relevant information.</p>
          <p>Below you can find the HyperPhysics pages that correspond to each class: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PHYS 151/161</strong>: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html#mechcon">Mechanics</a> and <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/heacon.html#heacon">Thermodynamics</a></li>
            <li><strong>PHYS 152/162</strong>: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/emcon.html#emcon">Electricity and Magnetism</a></li>
            <li><strong>PHYS 153/163</strong>: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ligcon.html#c1">Optics</a> and <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quacon.html#quacon">Modern Physics</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h4><a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/">Physics Stack Exchange</a></h4>
          <p>
            A forum site where people ask and answer all level of physics questions. People give thorough and helpful answers, and follow-up with discussions further explaining anything that isn't clear. I often use this site to look for help on specific homework problems. Since most universities use the same textbooks, you can almost always find a post with the exact numbers as the one in your book. And if your question hasn't been asked yet you can post yourself!

          <h3>Free textbooks</h3>
          <p>
            These textbooks are provided by <a href="https://openstax.org/">OpenStax</a>, a nonprofit, openly licensed college textbook company. They are completely free to use and download. They can be viewed online or downloaded as a PDF.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PHYS 151/161</strong>: <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=378">University Physics Volume 1</a> (chapters 1-15) and <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=379">University Physics Volume 2</a> (chapters 1-4)</li>
            <li><strong>PHYS 152/162</strong>: <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=379">University Physics Volume 2</a> (chapters 5-16)</li>
            <li><strong>PHYS 153/163</strong>: <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=380">University Physics Volume 3</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These textbooks are not the ones on your syllabus; however, the content is exactly the same, if not better. For the introductory courses especially, the specific textbook you use does not really matter. If you don't need the actual textbook for doing homework problems, I highly recommend using a free textbook. The college textbook publishing racket is a scam designed to rip college students off. Publishers charge exorbant prices for information that is freely available (such as through organizations like OpenStax). Furthermore, publishers "update" the textbook every few years by rearranging a few words and changing the numbers on all of the problems, rendering used textbooks useless and forcing students to buy new versions. Each and every one of us that chooses a free textbook over a paid one weakens publishers and empowers students âœŠ

          <h3>Videos</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics">Khan Academy</a></h4>
          <p>
            Khan Academy has video series for nearly any subject. The isntructor records himself writing on a virtual whiteboard while narrating, making the videos very clear and visul. The physics ones are very extensive; the link provided has videos pertaining to all three levels of the introductory physics classes. Videos are 10-20 minutes long, with the instructor working through common concepts and doing example problems.
